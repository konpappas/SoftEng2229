**intelliQ** application for managing smart questionnaires.

**Important notes**:
1) For the database, mariaDB is used. To install the database, create a database named `intelliq`. Then copy the sql code from database/intelliq.sql and run it in the database in order to be fully created.
2) For the REST-API nodejs is used, so it is required to be installed so the REST-API can run.
3) cli needs the Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned command to run in powershell.
4) To install cli, change directory to cli/se2229 folder of this project, and run the npm install -g se2229 command.
5) Please read the READ.md files of frontend, cli and test/api-testing folder in order to understand their use, and also the documentation of the REST-API (inside the api-backend folder).
